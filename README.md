# pokemon-battle-simulator
A command-line pokemon battle simulator

VersusBattle is the driver class.

Currently, only 2 pokemon and 8 different moves are available. This is a one player game, where the player controls Pikachu, while the
computer controls Gyarados. To make a move, simply input the number of the move that appears in the move list when playing the game.

Very basic pokemon game mechanics, including type effectiveness, stage, EVs, and IVs are incorporated.
